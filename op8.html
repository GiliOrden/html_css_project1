          <h1>Operation Dawn</h1>
          <h5>August 5, 2022 - August 7, 2022</h5>
          <p>
            Operation Dawn was a military operation by the IDF in the Gaza Strip
            against the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The IDF launched the
            operation with a targeted counterattack of Taysir al-Jabari, the
            commander of the northern division of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad
            in the northern Gaza Strip. The next day, Khaled Mansour, the
            commander of the southern division, was also killed. Throughout the
            operation, the Israeli Air Force attacked targets identified with
            The Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, including munitions
            warehouses and military positions, rocket launching facilities and
            other military targets. On the Israeli side, a "special situation in
            the home front" was implemented within 80 km of the Gaza Strip, and
            residents of the Gaza Strip were instructed to stay near protected
            areas.
