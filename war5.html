          <h1>Yom Kippur War</h1>
          <h5>(1973)</h5>
          <p>
            Fought from 6 to 26 October 1973 by a coalition of Arab states led
            by Egypt and Syria against Israel as a way of recapturing part of
            the territories which they lost to the Israelis back in the Six-Day
            War. The war began with a surprise joint attack by Egypt and Syria
            on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Egypt and Syria crossed the
            cease-fire lines in the Sinai and Golan Heights, respectively.
            Eventually Arab forces were defeated by Israel and there were no
            significant territorial changes.
