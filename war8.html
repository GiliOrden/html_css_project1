          <h1>Second Lebanon War</h1>
          <h5>(2006)</h5>
          <p>
            Began as a military operation in response to the abduction of two
            Israeli reserve soldiers by the Hezbollah. The operation gradually
            strengthened, to become a wider confrontation. The principal
            participants were Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israeli
            military. The conflict started on 12 July 2006 and continued until a
            United Nations-brokered ceasefire went into effect on 14 August
            2006, though it formally ended on 8 September 2006, when Israel
            lifted its naval blockade of Lebanon. The war resulted in a
            stalemate.
