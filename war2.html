          <h1>Sinai War</h1>
          <h5>(1956)</h5>
          <p>
            A military attack on Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, beginning
            on 29 October 1956, with the intention to occupy the Sinai Peninsula
            and to take over the Suez Canal. The attack followed Egypt's
            decision of 26 July 1956 to nationalize the Suez Canal after the
            withdrawal of an offer by Britain and the United States to fund the
            building of the Aswan Dam. Although the Israeli invasion of the
            Sinai was successful, the United States and USSR forced it to
            retreat. Even so, Israel managed to re-open the Straits of Tiran and
            pacified its southern border.
