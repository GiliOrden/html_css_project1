          <h5>(June 1967)</h5>
          <p>
            Fought between Israel and Arab neighbors Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.
            The nations of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, and others also
            contributed troops and arms to the Arab forces. Following the war,
            the territory held by Israel expanded significantly ("The Purple
            Line") : The West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, Golan
            Heights from Syria, Sinai and Gaza from Egypt.
