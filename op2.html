          <h1>The first intifada</h1>
          <h5>December 9, 1987 â€“ September 13, 1993</h5>
          <p>
            The first intifada was a mostly violent uprising, weakened
            significantly after the Gulf War, and officially ended with the
            signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. During it, the Palestinian
            residents of Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip revolted against
            the State of Israel. The intifada was sometimes called the "stone
            war", because at the beginning the Palestinians used stones and
            other improvised weapons. The goals of the intifada were divided
            into two: Immediate goals related to Judea, Samaria and Gaza
            themselves. and long-term policy goals.
