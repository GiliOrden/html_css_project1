          <h1>War of Independence</h1>
          <h5>(1967-1970)</h5>
          <p>
            A limited war fought between the Israeli military and forces of the
            Egyptian Republic, the USSR, Jordan, Syria, and the Palestine
            Liberation Organization from 1967 to 1970. It was initiated by the
            Egyptians as a way of recapturing the Sinai from the Israelis, who
            had been in control of the territory since the mid-1967 Six-Day War.
            The hostilities ended with a ceasefire signed between the countries
            in 1970 with frontiers remaining in the same place as when the war
            began.
