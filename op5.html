            Operation Pillar of Defense was a military operation by the IDF in
            the Gaza Strip. The operation began with the targeted assassination
            of Ahmed Jabari, the acting commander of the military wing of Hamas.
            During the operation, thousands of attacks were conducted on targets
            in the Gaza Strip, and at the same time about 1,500 were shot from
            the Gaza Strip Rockets were fired at the southern settlements and
            for the first time, firing was also carried out at the central
            cities including Rishon Lezion, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The
            operation ended a week later with the declaration of a cease-fire.
            The operation did not include a ground entry into the Strip and was
            mainly conducted by the Air Force and to a limited extent, the Navy,
            the Artillery Corps and other units .
