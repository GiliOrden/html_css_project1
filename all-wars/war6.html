          <h1>First Lebanon War</h1>
          <h5>(1982-1985)</h5>
          <p>
            Began on 6 June 1982, when the Israel Defense Forces entered
            southern Lebanon to expel the PLO from the territory. The Government
            of Israel ordered the invasion as a response to the assassination
            attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo
            Argov, by the Abu Nidal Organization and due to the constant terror
            attacks on northern Israel made by the Palestinian guerrilla
            organizations which resided in Lebanon. The war resulted in the
            expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon and created an Israeli Security
            Zone in southern Lebanon.
