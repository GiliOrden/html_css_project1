          <h1>War of Independence</h1>
          <h5>(1947â€“1949)</h5>
          <p>
            Started as 6 months of civil war between Jewish and Arab militias
            when the mandate period in Palestine was ending and turned into a
            regular war after the establishment of Israel and the intervention
            of several Arab armies. In its conclusion, a set of agreements were
            signed between Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, called the
            1949 Armistice Agreements, which established the armistice lines
            between Israel and its neighbours, also known as the Green Line.
