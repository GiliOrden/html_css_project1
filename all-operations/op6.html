            Operation Tzuk Eitan was a large-scale military operation led by the
            IDF in the Gaza Strip, during 50 days of fighting between Israel and
            Hamas and other terrorist organizations. The operation was announced
            following the IDF's "Operation Return of Brothers" after the
            kidnapping and murder of the three Israeli boys on June 12 of that
            year, and the murder of the Palestinian boy Muhammad Abu Khadir in
            Jerusalem.
