          <h1>The second intifada</h1>
          <h5>September 29, 2000 â€“ February 8, 2005</h5>
          <p>
            The second intifada was a violent Palestinian uprising against the
            State of Israel, which began at the end of September 2000. It broke
            out because of the events of the Wall Tunnel and the events of Nakba
            Day 2000. Terrorist operations and guerrilla warfare became its main
            expression. A distinct feature of the Palestinian activity in this
            struggle was the widespread use of suicide attacks against the
            citizens of the State of Israel, which began as early as October
            2000, about a month after it began and increased as it continued.
            The second intifada almost completely overturned the Oslo agreement
            of 1993. The construction of the separation fence and the death of
            Yasser Arafat at the end of 2004 led to the decline of the wave of
            terrorism in Judea and Samaria.
