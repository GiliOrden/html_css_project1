          <h1>Operation Cast Lead</h1>
          <h5>December 27, 2008 â€“ January 18, 2009</h5>
          <p>
            Operation Cast Lead was a large-scale military operation led by the
            IDF in the Gaza Strip, following the firing of rockets from the Gaza
            Strip at civilians and settlements in the western Negev. Three
            objectives were defined for the operation: the first - to create a
            security calm that would survive over time, the second - to prevent
            Hamas from arming itself, and the third - Return the kidnapped
            soldier Gilad Shalit. This goal was set only towards the end of the
            operation. On January 17, after 22 days of fighting, Israel
            announced a unilateral ceasefire, which came into effect the next
            day at 2 a.m., and its forces began to gradually withdraw from the
            Strip and finished their departure on January 21.
