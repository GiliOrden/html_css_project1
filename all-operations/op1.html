          <h1>Litany operation</h1>
          <h5>March 14, 1978 â€“ March 21, 1978</h5>
          <p>
            In Operation Litani, the IDF entered the southern part of Lebanon up
            to the Litani River, and held this area for about three months,
            until it withdrew back to the international border. The purpose of
            the operation was to damage the infrastructure of the Palestinian
            terrorist organizations in southern Lebanon, thus reducing their
            activity against the State of Israel and its citizens. The Israeli
            army had 18 dead, 113 wounded, 4 more soldiers were killed, the
            Palestinian terrorist organizations had about 300 dead.
